# About

<p>
Our collaborative group project has been a remarkable journey of teamwork and synergy among all members. We embarked on this project by establishing effective communication channels and task management systems. We utilized a Trello board to track our progress, coordinated our efforts through GitHub commits, and efficiently divided the workload. This experience has not only been a tremendous learning opportunity but also an essential aspect of our field.

With great pride, we present our projectâ€”a React application designed to leverage the YouTube API for seamless video searches. Our aim is to provide users with an immersive video browsing experience, allowing them to choose and watch videos from a curated selection.
